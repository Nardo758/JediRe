This can lead to security issues in various situations, such as the most commonly used signature verification (ECDSA) and shared key negotiation (ECDH). When the victim computes the shared secret as `S = [victim_private_key]P` via ECDH,  this leaks information about `victim_private_key mod (small_subgroup_order)`. For curves with cofactor > 1, this reveals the least significant bits of the private key.

However, suppose you have a proxy or reverse-proxy that tries to analyze HTTP requests, and your proxy has a _different_ bug in parsing Chunked-Encoding, acting as if the format is:\n\n- chunk length\n- `\\r\\n`\n- `length` bytes of content\n- more bytes of content, as many as it takes until you find a `\\r\\n`\n\nFor example, [pound](https://github.com/graygnuorg/pound/pull/43) had this bug -- it can happen if an implementer uses a generic \"read until end of line\" helper to consumes the trailing `\\r\\n`.\n\nIn this case, h11 and your proxy may both accept the same stream of bytes, but interpret them differently. For example, consider the following HTTP request(s) (assume all line breaks are `\\r\\n`):\n\n```\nGET /one HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n5\nAAAAAXX2\n45\n0\n\nGET /two HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n0\n```\n\nHere h11 will interpret it as two requests, one with body `AAAAA45` and one with an empty body, while our hypothetical buggy proxy will interpret it as a single request, with body `AAAAXX20\\r\\n\\r\\nGET /two ...`. And any time two HTTP processors both accept the same string of bytes but interpret them differently, you have the conditions for a \"request smuggling\" attack. For example, if `/two` is a dangerous endpoint and the job of the reverse proxy is to stop requests from getting there, then an attacker could use a bytestream like the above to circumvent this protection.\n\nEven worse, if our buggy reverse proxy receives two requests from different users:\n\n```\nGET /one HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n5\nAAAAAXX999\n0\n```\n\n```\nGET /two HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost\nCookie: SESSION_KEY=abcdef...\n```\n\n...it will consider the first request to be complete and valid, and send both on to the h11-based web server over the same socket. The server will then see the two concatenated requests, and interpret them as _one_ request to `/one` whose body includes `/two`'s session key, potentially allowing one user to steal another's credentials.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in h11 0.15.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSince exploitation requires the combination of buggy h11 with a buggy (reverse) proxy, fixing either component is sufficient to mitigate this issue.\n\n### Credits\n\nReported by Jeppe Bonde Weikop on 2025-01-09.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/security/advisories/GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-43859"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/commit/114803a29ce50116dc47951c690ad4892b1a36ed"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/python-hyper/h11"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-43859"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-02-12T02:46:35.890Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-jjg7-2v4v-x38h@idna-3.6","package":{"name":"idna","version":"3.6","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/idna"},"severity":{"level":"moderate","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"affectedVersions":{"specificVersions":["0.1","0.2","0.3","0.4","0.5","0.6","0.7","0.8","0.9","1.0","1.1","2.0","2.1","2.10","2.2","2.3","2.4","2.5","2.6","2.7","2.8","2.9","3.0","3.1","3.2","3.3","3.4","3.5","3.6"],"ranges":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"3.7"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"3.7"},"details":{"title":"Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) vulnerable to denial of service from specially crafted inputs to idna.encode","description":"### Impact\nA specially crafted argument to the `idna.encode()` function could consume significant resources.

The library must read compressed data from the network and decompress it until the requested chunk size is met. Any resulting decompressed data that exceeds the requested amount is held in an internal buffer for the next read operation.\n\nThe decompression logic could cause urllib3 to fully decode a small amount of highly compressed data in a single operation. This can result in excessive resource consumption (high CPU usage and massive memory allocation for the decompressed data; CWE-409) on the client side, even if the application only requested a small chunk of data.\n\n\n### Affected usages\n\nApplications and libraries using urllib3 version 2.5.0 and earlier to stream large compressed responses or content from untrusted sources.\n\n`stream()`, `read(amt=256)`, `read1(amt=256)`, `read_chunked(amt=256)`, `readinto(b)` are examples of `urllib3.HTTPResponse` method calls using the affected logic unless decoding is disabled explicitly.\n\n\n### Remediation\n\nUpgrade to at least urllib3 v2.6.0 in which the library avoids decompressing data that exceeds the requested amount.\n\nIf your environment contains a package facilitating the Brotli encoding, upgrade to at least Brotli 1.2.0 or brotlicffi 1.2.0.0 too. These versions are enforced by the `urllib3[brotli]` extra in the patched versions of urllib3.\n\n\n### Credits\n\nThe issue was reported by @Cycloctane.\nSupplemental information was provided by @stamparm during a security audit performed by [7ASecurity](https://7asecurity.com/) and facilitated by [OSTIF](https://ostif.org/).","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-2xpw-w6gg-jr37"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66471"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/c19571de34c47de3a766541b041637ba5f716ed7"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-66471"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-02-12T02:46:35.891Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf@urllib3-2.2.0","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"2.2.0","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3"},"severity":{"level":"moderate","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"},"affectedVersions":{"specificVersions":["0.2","0.3","0.3.1","0.4.0","0.4.1","1.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.1","1.10","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.10.3","1.10.4","1.11","1.12","1.13","1.13.1","1.14","1.15","1.15.1","1.16","1.17","1.18","1.18.1","1.19","1.19.1","1.2","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.20","1.21","1.21.1","1.22","1.23","1.24","1.24.1","1.24.2","1.24.3","1.25","1.25.1","1.25.10","1.25.11","1.25.2","1.25.3","1.25.4","1.25.5","1.25.6","1.25.7","1.25.8","1.25.9","1.26.0","1.26.1","1.26.10","1.26.11","1.26.12","1.26.13","1.26.14","1.26.15","1.26.16","1.26.17","1.26.18","1.26.2","1.26.3","1.26.4","1.26.5","1.26.6","1.26.7","1.26.8","1.26.9","1.3","1.4","1.5","1.6","1.7","1.7.1","1.8","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.9","1.9.1"],"ranges":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"1.26.19"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"1.26.19","requiresMajorUpdate":true},"details":{"title":"urllib3's Proxy-Authorization request header isn't stripped during cross-origin redirects","description":"When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected.\n\nHowever, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy.

is vulnerable to directory traversal","description":"### Summary\nImproperly configuring static resource resolution in aiohttp when used as a web server can result in the unauthorized reading of arbitrary files on the system.\n\n### Details\nWhen using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is necessary to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the option 'follow_symlinks' can be used to determine whether to follow symbolic links outside the static root directory. When 'follow_symlinks' is set to True, there is no validation to check if a given file path is within the root directory.This can lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the system, even when symlinks are not present.\n\ni.e. An application is only vulnerable with setup code like:\n```\napp.router.add_routes([\n    web.static(\"/static\", \"static/\", follow_symlinks=True),  # Remove follow_symlinks to avoid the vulnerability\n])\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis is a directory traversal vulnerability with CWE ID 22. When using aiohttp as a web server and enabling static resource resolution with `follow_symlinks` set to True, it can lead to this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been present since the introduction of the `follow_symlinks` parameter.\n\n### Workaround\nEven if upgrading to a patched version of aiohttp, we recommend following these steps regardless.\n\nIf using `follow_symlinks=True` outside of a restricted local development environment, disable the option immediately. This option is NOT needed to follow symlinks which point to a location _within_ the static root directory, it is _only_ intended to allow a symlink to break out of the static directory. Even with this CVE fixed, there is still a substantial risk of misconfiguration when using this option on a server that accepts requests from remote users.\n\nAdditionally, aiohttp has always recommended using a reverse proxy server (such as nginx) to handle static resources and _not_ to use these static resources in aiohttp for production environments. Doing so also protects against this vulnerability, and is why we expect the number of affected users to be very low.\n\n-----\n\nPatch: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8079/files","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-5h86-8mv2-jq9f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23334"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8079"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8079/files"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/1c335944d6a8b1298baf179b7c0b3069f10c514b"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/aiohttp/PYSEC-2024-24.yaml"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/02/msg00002.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ICUOCFGTB25WUT336BZ4UNYLSZOUVKBD"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XXWVZIVAYWEBHNRIILZVB3R3SDQNNAA7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/52474"}],"aliases":["CVE-2024-23334","PYSEC-2024-24"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-02-12T02:46:35.895Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-5m98-qgg9-wh84@aiohttp-3.9.1","package":{"name":"aiohttp","version":"3.9.1","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/aiohttp"},"severity":{"level":"high","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"affectedVersions":{"specificVersions":["0.1","0.10.0","0.10.1","0.10.2","0.11.0","0.12.0","0.13.0","0.13.1","0.14.0","0.14.1","0.14.2","0.14.3","0.14.4","0.15.0","0.15.1","0.15.2","0.15.3","0.16.0","0.16.1","0.16.2","0.16.3","0.16.4","0.16.5","0.16.6","0.17.0","0.17.1","0.17.2","0.17.3","0.17.4","0.18.0","0.18.1","0.18.2","0.18.3","0.18.4","0.19.0","0.2","0.20.0","0.20.1","0.20.2","0.21.0","0.21.1","0.21.2","0.21.4","0.21.5","0.21.6","0.22.0","0.22.0a0","0.22.0b0","0.22.0b1","0.22.0b2","0.22.0b3","0.22.0b4","0.22.0b5","0.22.0b6","0.22.1","0.22.2","0.22.3","0.22.4","0.22.5","0.3","0.4","0.4.1","0.4.2","0.4.3","0.4.4","0.5.0","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.2","0.6.3","0.6.4","0.6.5","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.7.3","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.8.2","0.8.3","0.8.4","0.9.0","0.9.1","0.9.2","0.9.3","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.5","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.1.5","1.1.6","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.3.5","2.0.0","2.0.0rc1","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","2.1.0","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.2.4","2.2.5","2.3.0","2.3.0a1","2.3.0a2","2.3.0a3","2.3.0a4","2.3.1","2.3.10","2.3.1a1","2.3.2","2.3.2b2","2.3.2b3","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.3.5","2.3.6","2.3.7","2.3.8","2.3.9","3.0.0","3.0.0b0","3.0.0b1","3.0.0b2","3.0.0b3","3.0.0b4","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.7","3.0.8","3.0.9","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.1.3","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.3.0","3.3.0a0","3.3.1","3.3.2","3.3.2a0","3.4.0","3.4.0a0","3.4.0a3","3.4.0b1","3.4.0b2","3.4.1","3.4.2","3.4.3","3.4.4","3.5.0","3.5.0a1","3.5.0b1","3.5.0b2","3.5.0b3","3.5.1","3.5.2","3.5.3","3.5.4","3.6.0","3.6.0a0","3.6.0a1","3.6.0a11","3.6.0a12","3.6.0a2","3.6.0a3","3.6.0a4","3.6.0a5","3.6.0a6","3.6.0a7","3.6.0a8","3.6.0a9","3.6.0b0","3.6.1","3.6.1b3","3.6.1b4","3.6.2","3.6.2a0","3.6.2a1","3.6.2a2","3.6.3","3.7.0","3.7.0b0","3.7.0b1","3.7.1","3.7.2","3.7.3","3.7.4","3.7.4.post0","3.8.0","3.8.0a7","3.8.0b0","3.8.1","3.8.2","3.8.3","3.8.4","3.8.5","3.8.6","3.9.0","3.9.0b0","3.9.0b1","3.9.0rc0","3.9.1","3.9.2","3.9.3","3.9.4rc0"],"ranges":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"3.9.4"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"3.9.4","requiresMajorUpdate":false},"details":{"title":"aiohttp vulnerable to Denial of Service when trying to parse malformed POST requests","description":"### Summary\nAn attacker can send a specially crafted POST (multipart/form-data) request.

HTTP parser (the python one, not llhttp) still overly lenient about separators","description":"### Summary\nSecurity-sensitive parts of the *Python HTTP parser* retained minor differences in allowable character sets, that must trigger error handling to robustly match frame boundaries of proxies in order to protect against injection of additional requests. Additionally, validation could trigger exceptions that were not handled consistently with processing of other malformed input.\n\n### Details\nThese problems are rooted in pattern matching protocol elements, previously improved by PR #3235 and GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg:\n\n1. The expression `HTTP/(\\d).(\\d)` lacked another backslash to clarify that the separator should be a literal dot, not just *any* Unicode code point (result: `HTTP/(\\d)\\.(\\d)`).\n\n2. The HTTP version was permitting Unicode digits, where only ASCII digits are standards-compliant.\n\n3. Distinct regular expressions for validating HTTP Method and Header field names were used - though both should (at least) apply the common restrictions of rfc9110 `token`.\n\n### PoC\n`GET / HTTP/1ö1`\n`GET / HTTP/1.𝟙`\n`GET/: HTTP/1.1`\n`Content-Encoding?: chunked`\n\n### Impact\nPrimarily concerns running an aiohttp server without llhttp:\n 1. **behind a proxy**: Being more lenient than internet standards require could, depending on deployment environment, assist in request smuggling.\n 2. **directly accessible** or exposed behind proxies relaying malformed input: the unhandled exception could cause excessive resource consumption on the application server and/or its logging facilities.\n\n-----\n\nPatch:

Impact\n\nIf an application makes use of the `request.read()` method in an endpoint, it may be possible for an attacker to cause the server to spend a moderate amount of blocking CPU time (e.g. 1 second) while processing the request. This could potentially lead to DoS as the server would be unable to handle other requests during that time.\n\n-----\n\nPatch:

is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. When using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is necessary to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the option 'follow_symlinks' can be used to determine whether to follow symbolic links outside the static root directory. When 'follow_symlinks' is set to True, there is no validation to check if reading a file is within the root directory. This can lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the system, even when symlinks are not present.  Disabling follow_symlinks and using a reverse proxy are encouraged mitigations.

is vulnerable to directory traversal","description":"### Summary\nImproperly configuring static resource resolution in aiohttp when used as a web server can result in the unauthorized reading of arbitrary files on the system.\n\n### Details\nWhen using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is necessary to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the option 'follow_symlinks' can be used to determine whether to follow symbolic links outside the static root directory. When 'follow_symlinks' is set to True, there is no validation to check if a given file path is within the root directory.This can lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the system, even when symlinks are not present.\n\ni.e. An application is only vulnerable with setup code like:\n```\napp.router.add_routes([\n    web.static(\"/static\", \"static/\", follow_symlinks=True),  # Remove follow_symlinks to avoid the vulnerability\n])\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis is a directory traversal vulnerability with CWE ID 22. When using aiohttp as a web server and enabling static resource resolution with `follow_symlinks` set to True, it can lead to this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been present since the introduction of the `follow_symlinks` parameter.\n\n### Workaround\nEven if upgrading to a patched version of aiohttp, we recommend following these steps regardless.\n\nIf using `follow_symlinks=True` outside of a restricted local development environment, disable the option immediately. This option is NOT needed to follow symlinks which point to a location _within_ the static root directory, it is _only_ intended to allow a symlink to break out of the static directory. Even with this CVE fixed, there is still a substantial risk of misconfiguration when using this option on a server that accepts requests from remote users.\n\nAdditionally, aiohttp has always recommended using a reverse proxy server (such as nginx) to handle static resources and _not_ to use these static resources in aiohttp for production environments. Doing so also protects against this vulnerability, and is why we expect the number of affected users to be very low.\n\n-----\n\nPatch: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8079/files","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-5h86-8mv2-jq9f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23334"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8079"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8079/files"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/1c335944d6a8b1298baf179b7c0b3069f10c514b"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/aiohttp/PYSEC-2024-24.yaml"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/02/msg00002.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ICUOCFGTB25WUT336BZ4UNYLSZOUVKBD"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XXWVZIVAYWEBHNRIILZVB3R3SDQNNAA7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/52474"}],"aliases":["CVE-2024-23334","PYSEC-2024-24"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-02-12T02:46:35.901Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-5m98-qgg9-wh84@aiohttp-3.9.1","package":{"name":"aiohttp","version":"3.9.1","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/aiohttp"},"severity":{"level":"high","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"affectedVersions":{"specificVersions":["0.1","0.10.0","0.10.1","0.10.2","0.11.0","0.12.0","0.13.0","0.13.1","0.14.0","0.14.1","0.14.2","0.14.3","0.14.4","0.15.0","0.15.1","0.15.2","0.15.3","0.16.0","0.16.1","0.16.2","0.16.3","0.16.4","0.16.5","0.16.6","0.17.0","0.17.1","0.17.2","0.17.3","0.17.4","0.18.0","0.18.1","0.18.2","0.18.3","0.18.4","0.19.0","0.2","0.20.0","0.20.1","0.20.2","0.21.0","0.21.1","0.21.2","0.21.4","0.21.5","0.21.6","0.22.0","0.22.0a0","0.22.0b0","0.22.0b1","0.22.0b2","0.22.0b3","0.22.0b4","0.22.0b5","0.22.0b6","0.22.1","0.22.2","0.22.3","0.22.4","0.22.5","0.3","0.4","0.4.1","0.4.2","0.4.3","0.4.4","0.5.0","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.2","0.6.3","0.6.4","0.6.5","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.7.3","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.8.2","0.8.3","0.8.4","0.9.0","0.9.1","0.9.2","0.9.3","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.5","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.1.5","1.1.6","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.3.5","2.0.0","2.0.0rc1","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","2.1.0","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.2.4","2.2.5","2.3.0","2.3.0a1","2.3.0a2","2.3.0a3","2.3.0a4","2.3.1","2.3.10","2.3.1a1","2.3.2","2.3.2b2","2.3.2b3","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.3.5","2.3.6","2.3.7","2.3.8","2.3.9","3.0.0","3.0.0b0","3.0.0b1","3.0.0b2","3.0.0b3","3.0.0b4","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.7","3.0.8","3.0.9","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.1.3","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.3.0","3.3.0a0","3.3.1","3.3.2","3.3.2a0","3.4.0","3.4.0a0","3.4.0a3","3.4.0b1","3.4.0b2","3.4.1","3.4.2","3.4.3","3.4.4","3.5.0","3.5.0a1","3.5.0b1","3.5.0b2","3.5.0b3","3.5.1","3.5.2","3.5.3","3.5.4","3.6.0","3.6.0a0","3.6.0a1","3.6.0a11","3.6.0a12","3.6.0a2","3.6.0a3","3.6.0a4","3.6.0a5","3.6.0a6","3.6.0a7","3.6.0a8","3.6.0a9","3.6.0b0","3.6.1","3.6.1b3","3.6.1b4","3.6.2","3.6.2a0","3.6.2a1","3.6.2a2","3.6.3","3.7.0","3.7.0b0","3.7.0b1","3.7.1","3.7.2","3.7.3","3.7.4","3.7.4.post0","3.8.0","3.8.0a7","3.8.0b0","3.8.1","3.8.2","3.8.3","3.8.4","3.8.5","3.8.6","3.9.0","3.9.0b0","3.9.0b1","3.9.0rc0","3.9.1","3.9.2","3.9.3","3.9.4rc0"],"ranges":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"3.9.4"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"3.9.4","requiresMajorUpdate":false},"details":{"title":"aiohttp vulnerable to Denial of Service when trying to parse malformed POST requests","description":"### Summary\nAn attacker can send a specially crafted POST (multipart/form-data) request.

HTTP parser (the python one, not llhttp) still overly lenient about separators","description":"### Summary\nSecurity-sensitive parts of the *Python HTTP parser* retained minor differences in allowable character sets, that must trigger error handling to robustly match frame boundaries of proxies in order to protect against injection of additional requests. Additionally, validation could trigger exceptions that were not handled consistently with processing of other malformed input.\n\n### Details\nThese problems are rooted in pattern matching protocol elements, previously improved by PR #3235 and GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg:\n\n1. The expression `HTTP/(\\d).(\\d)` lacked another backslash to clarify that the separator should be a literal dot, not just *any* Unicode code point (result: `HTTP/(\\d)\\.(\\d)`).\n\n2. The HTTP version was permitting Unicode digits, where only ASCII digits are standards-compliant.\n\n3. Distinct regular expressions for validating HTTP Method and Header field names were used - though both should (at least) apply the common restrictions of rfc9110 `token`.\n\n### PoC\n`GET / HTTP/1ö1`\n`GET / HTTP/1.𝟙`\n`GET/: HTTP/1.1`\n`Content-Encoding?: chunked`\n\n### Impact\nPrimarily concerns running an aiohttp server without llhttp:\n 1. **behind a proxy**: Being more lenient than internet standards require could, depending on deployment environment, assist in request smuggling.\n 2. **directly accessible** or exposed behind proxies relaying malformed input: the unhandled exception could cause excessive resource consumption on the application server and/or its logging facilities.\n\n-----\n\nPatch:

is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. When using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is necessary to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the option 'follow_symlinks' can be used to determine whether to follow symbolic links outside the static root directory. When 'follow_symlinks' is set to True, there is no validation to check if reading a file is within the root directory. This can lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the system, even when symlinks are not present.  Disabling follow_symlinks and using a reverse proxy are encouraged mitigations.

As a result, applications may unintentionally send requests without certificate verification, leading to potential man-in-the-middle attacks and compromised confidentiality or integrity.\n\nThis behavior affects versions of `requests` prior to 2.32.0.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35195"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6655"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/psf/requests/commit/a58d7f2ffb4d00b46dca2d70a3932a0b37e22fac"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/psf/requests"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IYLSNK5TL46Q6XPRVMHVWS63MVJQOK4Q"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/N7WP6EYDSUOCOJYHDK5NX43PYZ4SNHGZ"}],"aliases":["CVE-2024-35195"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-02-12T02:46:35.906Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-fj7x-q9j7-g6q6@black-23.11.0","package":{"name":"black","version":"23.11.0","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/black"},"severity":{"level":"moderate","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"},"affectedVersions":{"specificVersions":["18.3a0","18.3a1","18.3a2","18.3a3","18.3a4","18.4a0","18.4a1","18.4a2","18.4a3","18.4a4","18.5b0","18.5b1","18.6b0","18.6b1","18.6b2","18.6b3","18.6b4","18.9b0","19.10b0","19.3b0","20.8b0","20.8b1","21.10b0","21.11b0","21.11b1","21.12b0","21.4b0","21.4b1","21.4b2","21.5b0","21.5b1","21.5b2","21.6b0","21.7b0","21.8b0","21.9b0","22.1.0","22.10.0","22.12.0","22.3.0","22.6.0","22.8.0","23.1.0","23.10.0","23.10.1","23.11.0","23.12.0","23.12.1","23.1a1","23.3.0","23.7.0","23.9.0","23.9.1","24.1.0","24.1.1","24.1a1","24.2.0"],"ranges":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"24.3.0"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"24.3.0","requiresMajorUpdate":true},"details":{"title":"Black vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)","description":"Versions of the package black before 24.3.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the lines_with_leading_tabs_expanded function in the strings.py file.

An attacker can trigger this by providing a malicious configuration object created via `JSON.parse()`, causing complete denial of service.\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in `lib/core/mergeConfig.js` at lines 98-101:\n\n```javascript\nutils.forEach(Object.keys({ ...config1, ...config2 }), function computeConfigValue(prop) {\n  const merge = mergeMap[prop] || mergeDeepProperties;\n  const configValue = merge(config1[prop], config2[prop], prop);\n  (utils.isUndefined(configValue) && merge !== mergeDirectKeys) || (config[prop] = configValue);\n});\n```\n\nWhen `prop` is `'__proto__'`:\n\n1. `JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\": {...}}')` creates an object with `__proto__` as an own enumerable property\n2. `Object.keys()` includes `'__proto__'` in the iteration\n3. `mergeMap['__proto__']` performs prototype chain lookup, returning `Object.prototype` (truthy object)\n4. The expression `mergeMap[prop] || mergeDeepProperties` evaluates to `Object.prototype`\n5. `Object.prototype(...)` throws `TypeError: merge is not a function`\n\nThe `mergeConfig` function is called by:\n\n- `Axios._request()` at `lib/core/Axios.js:75`\n- `Axios.getUri()` at `lib/core/Axios.js:201`\n- All HTTP method shortcuts (`get`, `post`, etc.) at `lib/core/Axios.js:211,224`\n\n### PoC\n\n```javascript\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nconst maliciousConfig = JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\": {\"x\": 1}}');\nawait axios.get(\"https://httpbin.org/get\", maliciousConfig);\n```\n\n**Reproduction steps:**\n\n1.

The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).\n1. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n1. The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.\n1. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js`.\n\nIn this scenario, I assumed that the attacker knows the URL of the bundle output file name. But the attacker can also get that information by\n\n- Fetching `/index.html`: normally you have a script tag here\n- Fetching `/assets`: it's common to have a `assets` directory when you have JS files and CSS files in a different directory and the directory listing feature tells the attacker the list of files\n- Connecting `/esbuild` SSE endpoint: the SSE endpoint sends the URL path of the changed files when the file is changed (`new EventSource('/esbuild').addEventListener('change', e => console.log(e.type, e.data))`)\n- Fetching URLs in the known file: once the attacker knows one file, the attacker can know the URLs imported from that file\n\nThe scenario above fetches the compiled content, but if the victim has the source map option enabled, the attacker can also get the non-compiled content by fetching the source map file.\n\n### PoC\n\n1.

An attacker can trigger this by providing a malicious configuration object created via `JSON.parse()`, causing complete denial of service.\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in `lib/core/mergeConfig.js` at lines 98-101:\n\n```javascript\nutils.forEach(Object.keys({ ...config1, ...config2 }), function computeConfigValue(prop) {\n  const merge = mergeMap[prop] || mergeDeepProperties;\n  const configValue = merge(config1[prop], config2[prop], prop);\n  (utils.isUndefined(configValue) && merge !== mergeDirectKeys) || (config[prop] = configValue);\n});\n```\n\nWhen `prop` is `'__proto__'`:\n\n1. `JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\": {...}}')` creates an object with `__proto__` as an own enumerable property\n2. `Object.keys()` includes `'__proto__'` in the iteration\n3. `mergeMap['__proto__']` performs prototype chain lookup, returning `Object.prototype` (truthy object)\n4. The expression `mergeMap[prop] || mergeDeepProperties` evaluates to `Object.prototype`\n5. `Object.prototype(...)` throws `TypeError: merge is not a function`\n\nThe `mergeConfig` function is called by:\n\n- `Axios._request()` at `lib/core/Axios.js:75`\n- `Axios.getUri()` at `lib/core/Axios.js:201`\n- All HTTP method shortcuts (`get`, `post`, etc.) at `lib/core/Axios.js:211,224`\n\n### PoC\n\n```javascript\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nconst maliciousConfig = JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\": {\"x\": 1}}');\nawait axios.get(\"https://httpbin.org/get\", maliciousConfig);\n```\n\n**Reproduction steps:**\n\n1.
