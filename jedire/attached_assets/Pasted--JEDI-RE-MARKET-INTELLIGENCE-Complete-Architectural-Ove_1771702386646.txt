## 1.1 The Intelligence Stack

The Market Intelligence section is a three-layer system:

## 1.2 Signal Group Summary (89 Outputs)

| Signal Group | ID Range | Count | Level | Core Question |
|-------------|----------|-------|-------|---------------|
| **DEMAND** | D-01 to D-12 | 12 | MSA / Submarket | "Do enough people want to live here?" |
| **SUPPLY** | S-01 to S-10 | 10 | MSA / Submarket / Project | "How much competition is being built?" |
| **MOMENTUM** | M-01 to M-10 | 10 | MSA / Submarket / Property | "Which direction are rents and values moving?" |
| **POSITION** | P-01 to P-12 | 12 | Property | "What is the property's unique situation?" |
| **RISK** | R-01 to R-10 | 10 | All levels | "What could go wrong?" |
| **COMPOSITE** | C-01 to C-10 | 10 | All levels | "What does the AI think when it synthesizes everything?" |
| **TRAFFIC** ★ | T-01 to T-10 | 10 | Property | "How many people walk in this property per week?" |
| **DEV CAPACITY** ★ | DC-01 to DC-11 | 11 | Submarket / Parcel | "What COULD be built, not just what IS being built?" |
| **TRADE AREA** ★ | TA-01 to TA-04 | 4 | Property / Trade Area | "Who is the competitive set for this specific property?" |

## 1.3 Vertical vs. Horizontal View Architecture

```
MARKET INTELLIGENCE
│
├── VERTICAL VIEWS (deep-dive into ONE market)
│   │
│   └── My Markets → [Select Atlanta] → 5-Tab Dashboard
│       ├── Overview ─── 30-second snapshot
│       ├── Market Data ─ Full research library
│       ├── Submarkets ── WHERE within the market
│       ├── Trends ────── HOW is it changing
│       └── Deals ─────── Active opportunities + pipeline
│
├── HORIZONTAL VIEWS (compare ACROSS markets)
│   │
│   ├── Compare Markets ── Side-by-side 2-4 MSAs with AI recommendation
│   ├── Active Owners ──── Ownership intelligence across ALL tracked markets
│   └── Future Supply ──── Supply risk dashboard across ALL tracked markets
│
└── RELATIONSHIP: Vertical goes DEEP. Horizontal goes WIDE.
    A user typically starts horizontal (which market?),
    then goes vertical (deep into Atlanta),
    then goes horizontal again (who owns these properties across markets?).

## 2.7 TRAFFIC ENGINE — ★ NEW (10 outputs)

These answer: **"How many people walk into this property per week?"**

| ID | Output Name | What It Shows the User | Primary Source | Cost | Frequency | Level |
|----|-------------|----------------------|----------------|------|-----------|-------|
| T-01 | Weekly Walk-In Prediction | Actual estimated walk-ins/week (e.g., "2,847/week") | ADT + Census + Generators + Capture | Computed | Daily | Property |
| T-02 | Physical Traffic Score (0-100) | Drive-by and foot traffic volume passing the property | State DOT + Road Class + Intersect. | FREE | Monthly | Property |

**The Traffic Engine's key innovation**: It produces an actual NUMBER (2,847 walk-ins/week), not a score. This number feeds directly into revenue models: `walk-ins × conversion rate × avg rent = projected GPR velocity.`

**2×2 Matrix (T-04) classifications:**

```
              HIGH Physical Traffic
                     │
  HIDDEN GEM         │       VALIDATED WINNER
  (High phys, low    │       (Both high —
   digital = under-  │        expect competition)

                     │        fundamentals)
              LOW Physical Traffic
```

## 2.8 DEVELOPMENT CAPACITY INTELLIGENCE — ★ NEW (11 outputs)

These answer: **"What COULD be built? How constrained is supply long-term?"**

| ID | Output Name | What It Shows the User | Primary Source | Cost | Frequency | Level |
|----|-------------|----------------------|----------------|------|-----------|-------|
| DC-01 | Capacity Ratio | Remaining developable capacity as % of existing stock | Zoning + Vacant Parcels / S-01 | FREE | Quarterly | Submarket |
| DC-02 | Buildout Timeline | Years until submarket reaches practical build-out | Weighted Capacity / Annual Abs. | Computed | Quarterly | Submarket |
| DC-03 | Supply Constraint Score (0-100) | How supply-constrained is this submarket? Higher = more constrained = better | Composite: zoning + land + entitlement | Computed | Quarterly | Submarket |
| DC-04 | Supply Overhang Risk | Hidden supply in markets that LOOK safe | (Capacity − Pipeline) / Inventory | Computed | Quarterly | Submarket |
| DC-05 | Last Mover Advantage Flag | Near-buildout submarkets where last sites command premiums | Capacity < 15% + Active Dev > 0 | Computed | Quarterly | Submarket |
| DC-06 | Development Probability | Likelihood (0-100%) a specific vacant parcel gets developed | Owner + zoning + infra + market | Computed | Quarterly | Parcel |
| DC-07 | Pricing Power Index (0-100) | Ability to push rents without losing occupancy | DC-03 40% + D-01 25% + M-06 20% + M-03 inv 15% | Computed | Monthly | Submarket |
| DC-08 | Supply Wave Forecast (10yr) | Year-by-year supply projection: pipeline + capacity conversion | S-02 + S-03 + DC-06 weighted land | Computed | Quarterly | MSA/Sub |
| DC-09 | Developer Land Bank Index | Who owns developable parcels + predicted timing | Parcel ownership + DC-06 + behavior | FREE | Quarterly | Submarket |
| DC-10 | Assemblage Opportunity Score | Adjacent parcels that could combine for larger development | Spatial adjacency + capacity | Computed | Quarterly | Parcel Cluster |
| DC-11 | Supply-Adjusted Rent Forecast | Rent projection adjusted for BOTH pipeline AND capacity | C-02 base ± DC-03 factor | Computed | Monthly | Submarket |

**Key insight**: Industry standard sees 2 years of supply pipeline. JEDI sees 10+ years by analyzing zoning capacity, vacant land, and development probability. This fundamentally changes risk assessment.

## 2.9 TRADE AREA INTELLIGENCE — ★ NEW (4 outputs)

These answer: **"Who competes directly with this specific property?"**

| ID | Output Name | What It Shows the User | Primary Source | Cost | Frequency | Level |
|----|-------------|----------------------|----------------|------|-----------|-------|
| TA-01 | Trade Area Definition | User-defined or auto-generated competitive boundary | Radius / Drive-time / Traffic / Custom | FREE | User-set | Property |
| TA-02 | Competitive Set | Properties competing for the same renters within trade area | S-01 in TA + P-02 vintage match | Computed | Monthly | Property |
| TA-03 | Trade Area Supply-Demand Balance | Supply-demand ratio scoped to trade area (not MSA) | D-01 + S-01 within polygon | Computed | Monthly | Trade Area |
| TA-04 | Digital Competitive Intel | Website traffic and SEO performance of competing properties | SpyFu / SimilarWeb | $39/mo | Monthly | Property |

**Key insight**: An MSA-level supply-demand ratio can mask property-level reality. A property in Decatur (12.4% pipeline) has a completely different competitive situation than one in Buckhead (18.2%) — even though they're both "Atlanta." Trade Area outputs scope analysis to the relevant competitive boundary.

# PART 6: KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES

## 6.1 Progressive Disclosure
- **Overview**: 6 numbers + 5 bars + AI summary = 30 seconds
- **Market Data**: Full research library = 5-15 minutes
- **Property Flyout**: Every data point for one property = deep dive
- **Never force a user to see more than they need**

## 6.2 Data Attribution
- Every number shows source on hover: `"D-01 | Source: BLS + Municipal | Updated: Feb 15, 2026 | Confidence: HIGH"`
- Color language: Green = Demand, Red = Supply, Orange = Momentum, Purple = Position, Gray = Risk, Teal = Composite, Blue = Traffic, Violet = Dev Capacity

## 6.3 Vertical Goes Deep, Horizontal Goes Wide
- My Markets tabs = everything about ONE market
- Compare / Owners / Supply = questions that span MULTIPLE markets
- A user should never need to switch between single-market tabs to answer a cross-market question

## 6.4 The Traffic Engine Is Property-Level
- T-outputs appear in flyouts, deal cards, and opportunity rankings
- They do NOT appear as market-level aggregates (unlike D-outputs)
- Exception: T-02 and T-03 can be averaged per submarket for ranking table comparison

## 6.5 Dev Capacity Extends the Time Horizon
- Standard supply analysis: S-02 + S-03 = 2-year window
- Dev Capacity Intelligence: DC-01 through DC-11 = 10-year window
- They work TOGETHER: S-outputs show near-term, DC-outputs show long-term
- Future Supply page MUST show both layers, not just one

## 6.6 Trade Areas Scope the Analysis
- MSA-level metrics can mask property-level reality
- TA-01 defines the competitive boundary
- TA-02 identifies who competes directly
- TA-03 recalculates supply-demand within that boundary
- Every property analysis should default to trade area scope, with MSA as benchmark
