## 08:40-09:23 - Sprint #4 Day 6: Major Build Session

### Morning Discussion (08:40-09:02)

**Leon's Questions:**
1. Are all updates pushed to repo?
2. How does 3D Design Page work?
3. Deal creation flow - can some steps be removed?
4. Map dashboard efficiency - how to handle multiple purposes?

**Decisions Made:**
1. **Deal Creation Simplified:** Remove steps 8-12 (moved to Design Dashboard)
   - New flow: 6 steps (vs 12 before)
   - Order changed: Deal Details+Address first, then Dev Type, Category, Property Type, Docs, Trade Area
2. **Design Dashboard Scope:** Comprehensive workspace with:
   - Left: 4 panels (Subject Property, Competition, Traffic, Research)
   - Center: 4 map modes (2D/3D/Satellite/Split)
   - Right: Design controls + metrics + financial summary
   - Bottom: Data tables (competition/traffic/trends)
3. **Integration:** Design → Financial with "Send to Financial Model" button

### Agent Deployments (09:04-09:17)

**3 Agents Spawned:**
1. **refactor-deal-creation** (Sonnet) - Simplify deal flow to 6 steps
2. **design-dashboard** (Opus) - Build comprehensive design workspace
