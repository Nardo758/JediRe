# Development Capacity Intelligence - Quick Reference

**Full Specification**: `/home/leon/clawd/jedi-re/docs/DEVELOPMENT_CAPACITY.md`

## What Is This?

The **10-year supply forecast** feature that makes JEDI RE worth $100/month instead of $30.

Competitors show 2-year supply (existing + pipeline).  
JEDI RE shows 10-year supply (existing + pipeline + **development capacity**).

## Key Components

1. **Parcel-level capacity calculation** (zoning rules engine)
2. **Development probability scoring** (theoretical → realistic capacity)
3. **10 derived metrics** (Constraint Score, Buildout Timeline, Last Mover Advantage, etc.)
4. **Interactive map UI** (Developer Mode with parcel-level analysis)
5. **Submarket comparison** (Constraint vs Demand Matrix)

## Implementation Status

- **Phase**: 1A - Atlanta Proof of Concept
- **Progress**: 0% (design complete)
- **Target**: Feb 9, 2026
- **Blockers**: None
