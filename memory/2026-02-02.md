## JEDI RE Platform - Phase 1 Built Tonight

### Context
Leon shared two vision documents:
1. **Full Platform Vision** - Feature roadmap with supply calendars, traffic-to-lease correlation, AI analyst, broker OM comparison
2. **Intelligence Compression Framework** - Interdisciplinary methods (signal processing, ecology, game theory) to synthesize data into actionable signals

He asked me to create an integration plan. I didn't just plan—I built Phase 1.

### What I Built (in `/home/leon/clawd/jedi-re/`)

**1. Signal Processing Engine** (`src/signal_processing.py`, 6.9KB)
- Kalman filtering to clean noisy rent data
- Fourier transforms for seasonal decomposition
- Confidence scoring (SNR-based)
- Annualized growth rate calculation
- Working code with example output

**2. Carrying Capacity Engine** (`src/carrying_capacity.py`, 11.3KB)
- Ecological framework for sustainable supply analysis
- Calculates demand capacity from population + job growth
- Saturation analysis (supply/demand ratio)
- Timeline to equilibrium estimation
- Verdict classification: CRITICALLY_UNDERSUPPLIED → CRITICALLY_OVERSUPPLIED

**3. Imbalance Detector** (`src/imbalance_detector.py`, 16.5KB)
- Synthesizes both engines into unified signals
- Combines demand signal + supply signal = composite score (0-100)
- Produces verdicts: STRONG_OPPORTUNITY / MODERATE / NEUTRAL / CAUTION / AVOID
- Generates recommendations, key factors, risks
- Full working example with simulated Buckhead, Atlanta data

**4. Database Schema** (`src/database_schema.sql`, 9.6KB)
- PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB structure
- Tables: properties, submarkets, rents_timeseries, supply_pipeline, traffic_proxies, search_trends
- Signal storage: demand_signals, supply_signals, imbalance_signals
- User tables: users, deal_silos
- Helper views for latest rents and supply summaries

**5. Documentation**
- `README.md` - Complete overview, quick start guide, philosophy
- `docs/INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` - Week-by-week roadmap from code → working platform
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (numpy, scipy)

### Key Technical Decisions

**Why these engines first?**
1. **Signal Processing** - Pure math, no ML needed, immediate value (cleans rent noise)
2. **Carrying Capacity** - Validates core thesis (supply-demand imbalance detection)
3. Combined = MVP that produces actionable signals with confidence scores

**Data sources for MVP:**
- Apartment scrapers (Leon already has OppGrid)
- Google Trends API (free, search demand proxy)
- Census API (free, demographics)
- State DOT traffic counts (free, road exposure)
- SpyFu postponed (expensive, not critical for MVP)

**Architecture philosophy:**
- **Synthesis over accumulation** - Fewer signals with higher confidence
- **Progressive disclosure** - 4 levels from traffic light → raw data
- **Confidence always included** - Never show a number without showing how much to trust it

### What's Immediately Usable

All code is functional. Leon can:
1. Install numpy/scipy: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run: `python3 src/imbalance_detector.py`
3. See example output for Buckhead, Atlanta with simulated data
4. Replace simulated data with real scraped rents → get first real signal

### Next Steps (from Integration Plan)

**Week 2:** Connect Leon's apartment scrapers to database
**Week 3:** First real analysis on live data (pick 1 market)
**Week 4:** Simple web UI prototype (HTML + FastAPI)
**Month 2:** Scale to 10 submarkets, automated updates
**Month 3:** Beta testing with 5 real users

### Leon's Feedback
"this is where you need to be more proactive buddy"

He was right. I was describing what to build instead of building it. Fixed that tonight.

### Technical Notes
- Code tested locally (logic verified, example runs)
- Dependencies: numpy, scipy (standard data science stack)
- Database: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB recommended (handles timeseries efficiently)
- Deployment: Can start with $20/month VPS, scale later

### Business Context
Leon focuses on multifamily in Southeast US + Texas. Partners with Jeremy Myers. Building OppGrid (data aggregation) and Traveloure (travel platform). JEDI RE is the intelligence layer that makes OppGrid actionable.

**The big differentiator:** Not more data, better synthesis. Interdisciplinary methods (borrowed from epidemiology, ecology, signal processing) compressed into simple verdicts with confidence scores.

```

Total: ~61KB of working code + documentation produced tonight.

### Progress Tracking System Added

Created roadmap and progress tracking at Leon's request:

**Files created:**
- `jedi-re/ROADMAP.md` (6.9KB) - Full 12-month roadmap, 4 phases, weekly milestones
- `jedi-re/PROGRESS.md` (3.1KB) - Real-time progress log (updated as we go)
- Updated `HEARTBEAT.md` - Weekly progress check-ins on Sundays

**Progress reporting schedule:**
- Weekly updates every Sunday
- Monthly reviews first Monday of each month
- Track: what shipped, blockers, metrics, next actions

**Current status:**
- Phase 1, Week 1: ✅ COMPLETE (core engines shipped)
- Phase 1, Week 2: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (data integration, 0% complete)
- Overall: 8% complete (1/12 weeks of Phase 1)

**Next milestone:** Data Integration Complete (target: Feb 9, 2026)

**Blockers identified:**
1. Need access to Leon's apartment scrapers
2. Need PostgreSQL database set up
3. Need to select test market for first analysis

### Sub-Agent Parallelization (22:38 EST)

Leon requested spawning multiple agents to speed up development. Spawned 4 sub-agents working in parallel:

1. **jedi-db-setup** - Setting up PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB, running schema, creating test data
2. **jedi-api-layer** - Building FastAPI app, SQLAlchemy models, repositories, endpoints
3. **jedi-data-entry** - Creating manual data entry CLI tool
4. **jedi-simple-ui** - Building simple HTML viewer for analysis results

**Goal:** Complete minimal working end-to-end system in 45-60 minutes

**What we'll have when done:**
- ✅ Database with test data (Buckhead, Atlanta)
- ✅ Working API endpoints
- ✅ Tool to add more data manually
- ✅ Simple web page to view analysis

All agents working simultaneously on different components.
