# PROPERTY PLUMBING REFACTOR — IMPLEMENTATION MAP

**Document type:** Living implementation tracker  
**Last updated:** 2026-05-29  
**Sources:** `JEDI_RE_PROPERTY_PLUMBING_REFACTOR.md` (decisions) + `JEDI_RE_PROPERTY_PLUMBING_PHASES.md` (phase plan) + `property-plumbing-reality-check.md` (verified state) + Phase 1 work executed 2026-05-29

This document is the canonical source of truth for where the refactor stands. When plan and reality diverge, live state is marked and the plan adjusted here — not absorbed silently.

## ARCHITECTURAL COMMITMENTS (locked)

| Decision | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| D1 — Parcel ID as primary identity | LOCKED | `properties.parcel_id` (raw) + `parcel_id_canonical` (normalized, Phase 1b) |
| D2 — Immutable vs time-varying split | LOCKED | `properties` for immutable; `property_characteristics` for time-varying |
| D3 — Four target tables | LOCKED | All four built Phase 1. `property_records` deprecated Phase 4 (per 1.1.A). |
| D4 — `deals.property_id` as canonical FK | LOCKED | Column added Phase 1; dual-write via `DealPropertyLinkService` in Phase 2 |
| D5 — Comp inventory deprecated | LOCKED | `property_sales` canonical; `market_sale_comps` deprecated Phase 4 |
| D6 — Five-phase migration | LOCKED | 14-22 weeks total (Path B adjustment from 16-25) |

**Path B confirmed (2026-05-29):** Work against existing `properties` table in-place. No `properties_v2` parallel table. Phase 4 deprecation is column-level (drop time-varying columns from `properties` after readers migrated) rather than table rename. See Phase 4 notes for the two-window column-drop discipline.

## PHASE STATUS OVERVIEW

| Phase | Name | Status | Duration | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Schema Build | **COMPLETE ✅** | 2-3 weeks (actual: 1 day) | All AC met — see §1 |
| 2 | Dual-Write | NOT STARTED | 4-5 weeks | Phase 1 AC gate (now clear) |
| 3 | Reader Migration | NOT STARTED | 6-10 weeks | Phase 2 AC gate |
| 4 | Old-Table Deprecation | NOT STARTED | 2-4 weeks | Phase 3 AC gate |

---

## PHASE 1 — SCHEMA BUILD ✅

### Phase 1.1 — Pre-phase disposition questions (all resolved)

See full analysis in `docs/architecture/property-plumbing-phase1-dispositions.md`.

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| A. `property_records` vs `property_info_cache` | `property_info_cache` canonical. `property_records` deprecated Phase 4. 5 columns to migrate: `class_code`, `neighborhood_code`, `tax_district`, `assessor_url`, `property_class`. |
| B. `property_sales` stub strategy | Rename + new table (executed). |
| C. `discovered_properties` | Research agent staging intermediate. All 1,627 rows `unmatched`. No Phase 2 backfill. Kept as-is. |
| D. `county_parcels` / `fulton_parcels` / `fulton_structures` | All three tables have 0 rows. ArcGIS pipeline staging. Not part of canonical schema. |
| E. Parcel ID canonicalization | `parcel_id_canonical TEXT` added to `properties`. Format: `ga-cobb-20001202330`. Populated Phase 2. |

### What was built

**Migrations applied:**
- `20260529_phase1_property_entity_schema.sql` — four new tables, deals.property_id, properties identity columns
- `20260529_phase1b_parcel_id_canonical.sql` — `properties.parcel_id_canonical` column + index

**New schema tables:**

| Table | Cols | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `property_characteristics` | 16 | Time-varying physical state; effective_from/to versioning; source+confidence provenance |
| `property_operating_data` | 20 | Period-specific operating metrics; TTM/monthly/point-in-time; is_owned flag |
| `property_sales` | 24 | Canonical transaction table; implied_cap_rate; multi-source provenance |
| `property_sales_legacy` | 7 | Renamed from old `property_sales` stub; 292 rows preserved |

**Schema changes to existing tables:**

| Table | Column | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `deals` | `property_id UUID FK → properties.id` | Added Phase 1 (nullable) |
| `properties` | `parcel_id_status TEXT` | Added Phase 1 |
| `properties` | `is_superseded BOOLEAN` | Added Phase 1 |
| `properties` | `predecessor_property_id UUID` | Added Phase 1 |
| `properties` | `superseded_at TIMESTAMPTZ` | Added Phase 1 |
| `properties` | `parcel_id_canonical TEXT` | Added Phase 1b; index on non-null values |

**Services built (`backend/src/services/property-entity/`):**

| Service | File | Key methods |
|---|---|---|
| `PropertyCharacteristicsService` | `property-characteristics.service.ts` | `getCurrent`, `getHistory`, `getAsOf`, `create`, `getCurrentBatch` |
| `PropertyOperatingDataService` | `property-operating-data.service.ts` | `getLatestTtm`, `getAll`, `create` |
| `PropertySalesService` | `property-sales.service.ts` | `getSalesForProperty`, `getSalesByCriteria`, `recordSale`, `bulkIngestSales` |
| `PropertyResolverService` | `property-resolver.service.ts` | `resolveByParcel`, `resolveByAddress`, `mergeProperties`, `buildCanonicalParcelId` |
| `DealPropertyLinkService` | `deal-property-link.service.ts` | `resolveDealProperty`, `linkDealToProperty`, `bulkResolveDealProperties`, `getUnlinkedDeals` |

**Drizzle schema:** `backend/src/db/schema/propertyEntity.ts` (exported via `db/schema/index.ts`)

### Phase 1 acceptance criteria — final status

**⟹ PHASE 1 GATE: CLEAR. Phase 2 may begin.**

---

## PHASE 2 — DUAL-WRITE

**Status:** SHIPPED (Task #1488) — dual-write active behind `PROPERTY_DUAL_WRITE_ENABLED` flag (default `true`)  
**Duration:** 4-5 weeks  
**Key constraint:** Every dual-write is atomic (both writes or neither). Dual-write failures are P1 — alert on every failure, rollback both writes.

### Phase 2 delivery checklist (Task #1488)

- [x] `property_dual_write_failures` monitoring table (migration `20260529_phase2_dual_write_failures.sql`)
- [x] `PropertyDualWriteService` — central orchestrator with feature flag rollback (`PROPERTY_DUAL_WRITE_ENABLED`)
- [x] Write-path inventory doc: `docs/architecture/property-plumbing-phase2-write-path-inventory.md`
- [x] Georgia ingestion dual-write wired: Cobb, Fulton, Gwinnett, DeKalb (`dualWriteFromInfoCache` + `dualWriteFromGeorgiaSale`)
- [x] Deal creation dual-write wired: `inline-deals.routes.ts` → `dualWriteDealLink` (via `PropertyResolverService.resolveByAddress` → `deals.property_id`)
- [x] Backfill script 1: `backend/scripts/backfill-property-identity.ts`
- [x] Backfill script 2: `backend/scripts/backfill-property-characteristics.ts`
- [x] Backfill script 3: `backend/scripts/backfill-property-sales.ts`
- [x] Backfill script 4: `backend/scripts/backfill-property-operating-data.ts`
- [x] Backfill script 5: `backend/scripts/backfill-deal-property-links.ts`
- [x] Nightly Inngest reconciliation job: `backend/src/inngest/functions/property-reconciliation-nightly.ts`
- [x] `property-entity/index.ts` exports `PropertyDualWriteService`
- [x] No TypeScript errors introduced in Phase 2 files
- [x] Migration applied: 3 new Phase 1+2 migrations (applied 3, skipped 252, failed 0)

### 2.1 Pre-phase verification (before any code ships)

1. Re-verify all Phase 1 AC against live DB (don't trust memory)
2. Grep every write path to old tables:
   - `properties` (insert/update)
   - `deals` (address/city/state/lat/lng fields)
   - `recorded_transactions`
   - `market_sale_comps`, `market_rent_comps`, `comp_properties`
   - `property_records`, `property_info_cache`
   - `georgia_property_sales` (Inngest cron)
3. Map each write path → new-table dual-write target
4. Build the transactional wrapper before enabling any write path

### 2.2 Write paths to dual-write

| Old write target | New write target | Volume | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `properties` (time-varying fields) | `property_characteristics` | Low | Via `PropertyCharacteristicsService.create` |
| `deals.address/city/state/lat/lng` | `properties` (canonical) via `DealPropertyLinkService` | Per deal creation | `linkDealToProperty` handles both FKs |
| `recorded_transactions` | `property_sales` | ~0 (12 rows total) | Low priority |
| `property_info_cache` (ArcGIS cron) | `property_characteristics` | Weekly, 290K rows | After 1.1.A columns added |
| `property_records` (assessor scrapes) | `property_characteristics` | Per research agent run | Deprecated source; dual-write brief |
| `georgia_property_sales` (county cron) | `property_sales` | Weekly Inngest job | 681K rows to also backfill |
| `market_sale_comps` | **PAUSED** (comp ingestion suspended) | — | Resumes Phase 5 against `property_sales` |
| `market_rent_comps` | **PAUSED** | — | Resumes Phase 5 against `property_operating_data` |

### 2.3 Backfill scripts (5 scripts, run in order)

| Script | Source | Target | Row estimate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Backfill 1 — Identity | `properties` (1,596) + `property_info_cache` (290K) + `property_records` (249K) | `properties.parcel_id_canonical` + missing identity fields | ~290K unique | Dedup: parcel_id_canonical exact match = same property. 50-spot-check against county records. |
| Backfill 2 — Characteristics | `properties` time-varying cols + `property_info_cache` | `property_characteristics` | ~290K | One row per property, effective_from = fetched_at/data_as_of |
| Backfill 3 — Sales | `georgia_property_sales` (681K) + `recorded_transactions` (12) + `property_sales_legacy` (292) + `market_sale_comps` (343K, Cobb) | `property_sales` | ~681K deduped | Dedup: same parcel_id + sale_date = one row. 100-spot-check. |
| Backfill 4 — Operating data | T12/rent roll in `deal_data` JSONB + ApartmentIQ | `property_operating_data` | Low | `is_owned = TRUE` for M22 actuals |
| Backfill 5 — Deal linkage | `deal_properties` (27 rows) + `properties.deal_id` (32 rows) | `deals.property_id` | 32 deals | Use `DealPropertyLinkService.getUnlinkedDeals()`. Zero null property_id after. |

**Reconciliation pass after each backfill:** tier authority (operator > deal docs > owned portfolio > public records > third party > inferred) resolves conflicts; material conflicts surface for operator review.

### 2.4 Phase 2 monitoring

Nightly reconciliation script:
- Row count parity between old and new tables (within expected variance)
- 100-row sample nightly, field-level correspondence verified
- Any dual-write failure from prior day surfaced + investigated
- Divergence > tolerance → alert

### 2.5 Phase 2 acceptance criteria

- [ ] All production write paths dual-writing (grep + integration test)
- [ ] Zero dual-write failures over 7-day rolling window
- [ ] All 5 backfills complete with spot-check verification
- [ ] All 32 deals have non-null `deals.property_id` (`DealPropertyLinkService.getUnlinkedDeals()` returns empty)
- [ ] `properties` has ≥ 1,596 rows with parcel_id_canonical populated for known parcels
- [ ] `property_sales` has ≥ 681K rows (georgia_property_sales backfill)
- [ ] Nightly reconciliation script clean for 5 consecutive nights
- [ ] Layer 2 verification: 50 properties spot-checked; new-table data matches source

## PHASE 3 — READER MIGRATION

**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Duration:** 6-10 weeks

### Migration discipline (non-negotiable per reader)

1. Feature flag created: `use_new_property_schema_<reader_name>` — default OFF
2. New code path added alongside old
3. Shadow comparison runs ≥ 1 week (old path live; new path runs in parallel; divergences logged, not served)
4. Flag ON for 10% canary; metrics monitored
5. Flag ON for 100%
6. Old code path removed after 30 days stable at 100%
7. Verification protocol Layer 1 + Layer 2 documented per reader

### Reader migration waves

**Wave 1 — Foundation (weeks 2-3)**
1. `DealService.getProperty(deal_id)` → reads `deals.property_id` → `PropertyResolverService`
2. Cashflow agent property-info tools → reads `property_characteristics` via service layer

**Wave 2 — Valuation (weeks 3-5)**
3. Valuation Grid subject side → `PropertyCharacteristicsService` instead of `properties` direct
4. Valuation Grid comp side → `PropertySalesService.getSalesByCriteria()` instead of `market_sale_comps`
5. M15 comp services (comp-query, comp-set-discovery)
6. Comp relevance scoring (D-COMP-1, if built before this phase)

**Wave 3 — Analytical (weeks 5-7)**
7. F3 Markets module
8. F4 Supply module
9. F6 Traffic module
10. F8 Debt module (lower priority)

**Wave 4 — Strategy-aware (weeks 7-9)** *(after Wave 2 complete)*
11. Strategy-aware comp selection
12. Strategy projection service

**Wave 5 — Post-close + capsule (weeks 8-10)**
13. M22 post-close intelligence → `property_operating_data` with `is_owned = TRUE`
14. Deal Capsule rendering
15. Freeze-on-share snapshot

### Phase 3 acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every reader migrated; flag at 100%; ≥ 30 days stable
- [ ] Old code paths removed; grep confirms zero reads on old tables
- [ ] Backtest harness re-run; results equivalent or better
- [ ] Bishop end-to-end run equivalent or improved
- [ ] All readers in `docs/operations/PROPERTY_REFACTOR_READER_AUDIT.md`

---

## PHASE 4 — OLD-TABLE DEPRECATION

**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Duration:** 2-4 weeks

### Path B column-drop discipline (two 7-day windows — stricter than parallel-table approach)

Under Path B, a missed reader doesn't hit a permission error on the old *table* — it hits a runtime error on a dropped *column*. Cost of miss is higher. Two sequential windows required:

**Window 1 — Write revocation (7 days):**
Revoke INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on the target columns (or tables where all columns are being dropped).
Monitor for permission errors → surfaces missed writers before columns drop.

**Window 2 — Read revocation (7 days):**
After Window 1 clean: revoke SELECT on target columns.
Monitor for runtime errors → surfaces missed readers before the DROP.

Only after both windows are clean: DROP column (or table).

### Deprecation targets

**Tables to drop (Phase 4):**
- `recorded_transactions` (12 rows; replaced by `property_sales`)
- `market_sale_comps` (343K rows; replaced by `property_sales`)
- `market_rent_comps` (replaced by `property_operating_data`)
- `comp_properties` (replaced by `properties` + `property_characteristics`)
- `property_sales_legacy` (292 rows; backfilled to `property_sales` in Phase 2)
- `deal_properties` (legacy join table; replaced by `deals.property_id`)
- `property_records` (249K rows; replaced by `property_info_cache` + backfill in Phase 2)

**Columns to drop from `properties` (time-varying, moved to `property_characteristics`):**
Identify via Phase 3 reader migration — any column that moved to `property_characteristics` and has zero readers after Wave 1-2. Two-window drop sequence applies per column batch.

**Tables to keep:**
- `property_info_cache` — the canonical assessor layer going forward (not deprecated)
- `county_parcels`, `fulton_parcels`, `fulton_structures` — empty ArcGIS staging; review in Phase 5

### 4.4 Archive before drop

Each deprecated table: final snapshot → documented in `docs/operations/PROPERTY_REFACTOR_ARCHIVE.md` → drop. Keep archives ≥ 1 year.

### Phase 4 acceptance criteria

- [ ] All deprecated tables dropped (or two-window sequence complete for column drops)
- [ ] `properties` narrowed to identity + immutable columns
- [ ] `deals.property_id` is the sole canonical deal→property FK; `deal_properties` dropped
- [ ] No permission errors; no orphaned FKs
- [ ] Archive backup confirmed accessible for each dropped table

---

## PHASE 5 — COMP / VALUATION GRID INTEGRATION

**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks

### What resumes

- **Comp ingestion (paused):** #1477/#1479 Fulton/Gwinnett ingest resume — writing into `property_sales` + `property_characteristics`, not `market_sale_comps`
- **Strategy-aware comp selection:** M15 reads `PropertySalesService.getSalesByCriteria()` with strategy filters
- **Comp-anchored cap rate (Path B):** Per-comp NOI from `property_operating_data` → implied cap rate → P25/P50/P75 market cap rate → Cap × NOI valuation method
- **Backtest re-run:** S1 deals (Jacksonville, Atlanta ×2); expected ≥ 3 of 5 methods active vs 2 pre-refactor

### Phase 5 acceptance criteria

- [ ] All 10 original spec Part 9 acceptance criteria pass
- [ ] Backtest equivalent or better vs pre-refactor baseline
- [ ] No active deal returns INSUFFICIENT on subject-side data
- [ ] `property_sales` queryable at 681K+ rows
- [ ] Strategy-aware comp selection producing appropriate sets
- [ ] Comp-anchored cap rate synthesis active and within sanity bounds

## VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (cross-phase)

| Phase | Layer 1 (exists where it runs) | Layer 2 (correct on real data) | Layer 3 (defensible end-to-end) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 ✅ | Tables/cols/services exist — VERIFIED | n/a (no prod data) | n/a |
| 2 | Dual-write actually writes both; backfill populates | 50 properties spot-checked | n/a |
| 3 | Each reader reads new schema | Output equivalent for sample data | Backtest passes |
| 4 | Old tables/columns dropped; no orphan refs | No permission errors; clean app behavior | Bishop E2E produces expected output |
| 5 | Comp ingestion writes new schema; strategy wired | Sample comp queries return appropriate sets | Backtest equivalent or better |

---

## ROLLBACK CAPABILITY (cross-phase)

| Phase | Rollback | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | DROP new tables; no production impact | LOW |
| 2 | Disable dual-write; new tables orphaned; production unchanged | LOW |
| 3 | Feature flag flip per reader; instant per feature | LOW |
| 4 | Restore from archive; high cost | HIGH — Phase 4 rollback is expensive; verify before each column drop |
| 5 | Re-enable old code paths | MEDIUM |
