Instructions for manual edit to MarketDataPageV2.tsx:

Around line 239, find this code:

        return (
          <MarketResearchLayout

And change it to:

        return (
          <>
            <IntelligenceTabNav />
            <MarketResearchLayout

Then at the end, find:

            {renderTabContent()}
          </MarketResearchLayout>
        );

And change it to:

            {renderTabContent()}
          </MarketResearchLayout>
          </>
        );

This wraps the MarketResearchLayout in a React fragment and adds the IntelligenceTabNav component at the top.
