# HEARTBEAT.md

## 🎯 Primary Mission
Keep projects moving forward. Check progress, unblock issues, report important updates.

## 📊 Project Tracking Integration

### On Every Heartbeat Check:
1. Read `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` for current status
2. Read `SPRINT.md` for this week's tasks
3. Check for:
   - Blockers that can be resolved
   - Tasks that can be advanced
   - Updates that need logging

### Auto-Update Tasks:
- If meaningful progress made → Update `PROJECT_TRACKER.md`
- If task completed → Mark in `SPRINT.md`
- If blocker resolved → Update both tracker and sprint
- Always log to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## 🔄 Standard Checks (Rotate 2-4x per day)

### Project Work (Priority)
- **JEDI RE:** Any tasks I can advance? Blockers resolved?
- **Apartment Locator AI:** Integration progress? Moltworker ready?
- **Sprint:** Are we on track for this week's goals?

### External Checks
- Email inbox (urgent only)
- Calendar (next 24-48h)

## 📈 Weekly Checks (Sundays)

### Sprint Review
1. Read `SPRINT.md` - mark what's complete
2. Calculate completion % (tasks done / total tasks)
3. Update `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` with week's progress
4. Identify what's carrying over to next sprint

### Progress Report

## 🚧 Blocker Monitoring

### Current Critical Blockers:
- **JEDI RE:** Python dependencies (need Leon at PC)
- **Apartment Locator AI:** Moltworker deployment decision

### Check on Every Heartbeat:
- Can I resolve any blockers?
- Can I advance work around blockers?
- Should Leon be notified?

## ⏰ Quiet Hours
- 23:00-08:00 EST (only urgent items)

## 📣 When to Reach Out

### Always Report:

- Critical blockers that need Leon
- Milestone achieved
- Something broke that needs attention

### Usually Report:
- Significant progress (>20% of a major feature)
- Found a solution to a problem
- Important emails or calendar events <2h away
- Discovered something interesting/valuable

### Don't Report (HEARTBEAT_OK):
- Late night unless urgent
- Nothing new since last check (<30 min)
