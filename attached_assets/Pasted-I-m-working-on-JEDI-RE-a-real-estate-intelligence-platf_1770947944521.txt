I'm working on JEDI RE, a real estate intelligence platform. Today we built a complete 17-tab deal management system with 4 parallel build phases. Here's what was delivered:

## System Overview
- 17 comprehensive tabs (Overview, Map View, AI Agent, Competition, Supply, Market, Debt, Financial, Strategy, Due Diligence, Team, Documents, Timeline, Notes, Files, Exit, Context)
- Each tab has dual-mode support (acquisition vs performance)
- Real-time collaboration via WebSocket
- AI-powered analysis with 8 expert personas (CFO, Accountant, Marketing, Developer, Legal, Lender, Acquisitions, Asset Manager)
- Spatial intelligence with Mapbox integration
- ~70,000 lines of code pushed today across 4 commits

## What Needs to be Done Next

1. **Run Database Migration:**
   - Execute `backend/migrations/018_asset_map_intelligence.sql`
   - Creates 5 new tables: asset_news_links, asset_notes, note_replies, note_categories, asset_note_permissions
   - Adds PostGIS spatial functions

2. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env.local`
   - Add VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN (get from mapbox.com)
   - Configure API endpoints
   - Set WebSocket URL

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install` (includes socket.io-client, mapbox-gl)
   - Backend: `cd backend && npm install` (includes socket.io)

4. **Start Services:**
   - Backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
   - Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`

5. **Test the System:**
   - Navigate to deal detail page
   - Test all 17 tabs load
   - Test mode switching (pipeline ↔️ owned)
   - Test Map View with Mapbox
   - Test AI Agent with role switching
