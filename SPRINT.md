- Evening Session 2: 5 3D Development Modules (12 min parallel build)
- Evening Session 3: Deal Creation Flow Integration (Steps 9-12)
- Evening Session 4: Qwen AI Integration Phase 2 (7 AI services, 8 endpoints)
- **Most productive day in JEDI RE history!**

**3. Real Data Integration Success**
- Fulton County import: 1,028 properties, 249K units, 39 seconds
- UPSERT strategy: Safe to re-run anytime
- Market Intelligence: 12 outputs using real Atlanta data
- Production verified: Property import tested and working

**4. Documentation Excellence**
- Every system delivered with comprehensive docs
- WIRING_GUIDE.md for quick integration (10 min)
- Phase-based architecture docs (clear staging: UI → Components → Engine)
- Retrospective docs capture learnings

**5. Strategic Breakthroughs**
- 10-Year Supply Wave (key competitive differentiator)
- Development Platform vision (not just deal tracker)
- Property Types + Strategies matrix (51 types × 4 strategies = 204 combinations)
- Neighboring Property AI (assemblage opportunity identification)

### 🔧 What Could Be Improved

**1. Git Workflow**
- Day 5 had merge conflict scare (turned out to be unstaged files)
- **Action:** More frequent commits during multi-hour sessions
- **Action:** Consider feature branches for large multi-component builds

**2. Blocker Management**
- Python dependencies blocker persisted entire sprint
- Moltworker decision remains unresolved (Apartment Locator AI blocked)
- **Action:** Escalate blockers earlier, don't let them linger
- **Action:** Find workarounds or parallel paths when blocked

**3. Testing Coverage**
- Built many systems, but end-to-end testing deferred
- Some features not yet production-tested (3D modules, Qwen AI)
- **Action:** Allocate explicit testing time in sprint plans
- **Action:** Create test checklists alongside feature builds

**4. Scope Management**
- Day 5 delivered 11 systems (way beyond plan)
- Risk of over-building without validation
- **Action:** Get feedback earlier, iterate faster
- **Action:** Consider "build minimum → test → expand" approach

**5. Communication Timing**
- Some major builds happened during Leon's off-hours
- Could have gotten feedback/direction earlier
- **Action:** Align major build sessions with Leon's active hours when possible

### 📋 Action Items for Sprint #5

**Process Improvements:**
1. ✅ **Git commits:** Commit after each major milestone (not end of session)
2. ✅ **Blocker escalation:** Flag blockers in daily check-ins, propose workarounds
3. ✅ **Testing allocation:** Explicit testing tasks in sprint plan (20% of time)
4. ✅ **Feedback loops:** Share work-in-progress earlier for validation

**Technical Debt:**
1. ⬜ **End-to-end testing:** Property type flow, Market Intelligence, 3D modules
2. ⬜ **Python environment:** Finally resolve dependencies blocker
3. ⬜ **Moltworker decision:** Make infrastructure choice for Apartment Locator AI
4. ⬜ **Performance audit:** Check page load times, optimize slow queries
5. ⬜ **Migration cleanup:** Run pending migrations, document execution

**Product Priorities:**
1. ⬜ **Market Intelligence Phase 3:** Build 89 calculation services (intelligence engine)
2. ⬜ **Production deployment:** Get both platforms live
3. ⬜ **Beta testing:** Recruit 3-5 beta users, collect feedback
4. ⬜ **Documentation:** User guides, video walkthroughs
